Fish liver is  the site of chemical metabolism that can lead to excretion of chemicals from the organism.  However, reactive intermediates and metabolites can induce liver cell injury.

Students are introduced to a range of literary techniques drawn from fiction and poetry, techniques of style, language and story-telling chosen to enrich the kinds of reflection, observation, analysis, research and reporting essential to fact-based writing. Advanced courses are intended for students who show potential for professional standards of writing. Advanced writers produce work in specialized genres such as memoir, lifewriting (including diaries and letters), literary journalism, travel writing, science writing, historical narrative, literary cultural analysis, the personal essay, the lyric essay, the exploratory and experimental essay. The goal of the anthology is to demonstrate, as the literary critic Sven Birkerts says, \"What happens in the world...is far more unlikely and interesting than what a novelist can invent.\"</p>\r\n<p>The name \"Prospect\" was chosen for the anthology because the department wanted a Brown name with Providence connections, and connotations of journeying, moving forward, pioneering, sailing to new waters.

Due to her status as a writer and intellectual, and as the wife of a fellow diplomat, Salma Haffar Kuzbari moved in many of the same societal circles as Qabbani, both in Madrid and in Syria, and it was their friendship that led to the inclusion of these letters in her collection. Scholars in the field of Arabic literature are often all too aware of the fact that the gifted writers to whom they dedicate so much time and study are frequently ignored or unappreciated in the West, regardless of their prodigious artistic talent or widespread popularity in their home cultures. However, Nizar Qabbani is one of the few Arab poets whose massive and passionate following in the Arabic-speaking world has catapulted him to such a high level of recognition that he approaches, if not outright transcends, this cultural barrier. To say that he is one of the most-read poets (if not the most-read) in the Arab world today would not be an understatement; his accessible, yet masterfully poignant works ran the gamut from love poetry to pieces of political criticism, and were often adapted into popular ballads sung by the biggest stars of Arabic music.

The aim of this collection is to preserve and publicly disseminate the images of historical sites, and the video and audio recordings of traditional performances and interviews related to the memories of slavery and the slave trade in northern Ghana. Dr. Saboro collected these sources while conducting field work in the Bulsa and Kasena traditional areas for his Ph.D. dissertation, <a href=\"https://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:12715\">\u201cSlavery, Memory and Orality: Analysis of Song Texts from Northern Ghana\u201d</a> (University of Hull, 2014). <p>Dr. Saboro\u2019s research explores the memories of slavery and the slave trade among the Bulsa and Kasena of northern Ghana and focuses on late nineteenth century internal slave trafficking. Previous studies on memories of the slave trade in Ghana have focused on the transatlantic slave trade and the trauma of the Middle Passage and have relied on the use of conventional historical methodology such as shipping records, missionary and traveller accounts and the perspectives of colonial officials leaving out the experiences of the descendants of those who were mostly considered as victims. Dr. Saboro\u2019s work on songs and oral traditions, by contrast, adopts an interdisciplinary approach and engages with new material from the interior of Africa where most slaves were captured and aims at shifting the focus from the use of conventional historical methodology by seeking to establish the voices of descendants of enslaved communities in northern Ghana through a critical study of their songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All participants have consented to the retention and online public sharing of their images, interviews, and performances.

Specifically, this project tests in a field and survey experimental framework whether and how employers screen student job applicants based on immigration and legal status for employment positions. This project includes all the instruments, protocols, documentation, and data for other scholars interested in experimental design to replicate the results, adapt them for use in other contexts, or expand them to other treatments. This collection also includes training materials, including information on job applicants\u2019 hiring rights, for institutions of higher education, immigrant-serving organizations, and students interested in entering the labor market. <p>There are two main objectives for the societal impacts of this project. The first is to enable scholars from a wide variety of disciplines to easily access and utilize these documents, whether that be to replicate the results, adapt them for their own purpose, or expand them to other labor market, schooling, or treatment contexts. The second objective is to enable institutions of higher education, immigrant-serving organizations, and students to easily learn from the results. It is important for immigrants entering the labor market to learn how employers screen information on immigration and legal status. This product will preserve employer behavior and translate the results into training materials so that students benefit when applying for jobs.</p>\r\n<p>Author: A.
